Check back regularly for bug fixes and new features!

## Installation

Releases can be found [here](https://github.com/PKBeam/AMWin-RP/releases).

If you have (or are able to install) the [.NET 7.0 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0), you can download the `NoRuntime` release.

Otherwise, download the other release (the one that isn't labelled as `NoRuntime`). This release is larger in size as it bundles the necessary components of .NET 7.

## Usage

Only the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/apple-music-preview/9PFHDD62MXS1) version of Apple Music is supported.     
The app must be open and currently playing music in order for the rich presence to show. 

The app runs in the background, minimised to the system tray. 

It can be closed by right-clicking on the tray icon and selecting "Exit".
