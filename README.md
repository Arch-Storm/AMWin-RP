![GitHub release (latest by date including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads-pre/PKBeam/AMWin-RP/latest/total)

## Installation

This app uses .NET 7. If you have (or are able to install) the [.NET 7.0 runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0), you can download the `NoRuntime` release.

Otherwise, download the other unlabelled release. This release is larger in size as it bundles the necessary components of .NET 7.
